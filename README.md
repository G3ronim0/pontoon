Pontoon
=======
Pontoon enables localizers to translate web apps and web sites in place with
context and spatial limitations right in front of them. A full list of extracted
strings is also available, to help with strings that are hard to reach, e.g.
error messages and the `<title>` tag.
[Localizer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Localizing_with_Pontoon).

To enable localization of your site with Pontoon, include a script to overcome
cross frame scripting, and Pontoon will autodetect strings. Or, to make the best
out of Pontoon, fully prepare your site with hooks that will mark strings for
localization and include all the neccessary tags.
